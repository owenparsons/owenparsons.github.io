I'm a machine learning engineer / data scientist based in Oxford, UK. I'm particularly interested in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Outside of work I sometimes do hobby projects [which you can find here](https://owenparsons.github.io/projects/).

I have a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from the University of Cambridge. My thesis focused on the understanding how individuals implicitly build perceptual predictions in uncertain environments and how visual perception is influenced by these predictions. In particular, I looked into how these relationships might differ in clinical populations. You can read a [short interview where I talk about my PhD here](https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/blog/2019/03/11/congratulations-to-owen-parsons-for-completing-his-phd/)

I'm also very interested in science communication and science policy. You can read a bit more about [what I've done here](https://owenparsons.github.io/comms/).
