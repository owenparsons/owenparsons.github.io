News writing
======

During my PhD, I spent a year as a writer for the psychiatry department's news team before taking on the role of editor for 2 years. You can read some of the articles I worked on here: https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/blog/category/news/

At the end of my PhD, I did a short interview with the news team about my thesis research. You can read that here: https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/blog/2019/03/11/congratulations-to-owen-parsons-for-completing-his-phd/

Policy work
======
During my PhD I completed policy placements at the Cabinet Office and the Government Office for Science. These were funded by the MRC and RCUK respectively. If you're a PhD student would be interested in applying for the RCUK scheme, you can find more information here: https://www.ukri.org/skills/policy-internships-scheme/ or feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

I spent 3 months working at the Open Innovation Team, which is part of the Cabinet Office.

I also spent 3 months working at the Government Office for Science.
