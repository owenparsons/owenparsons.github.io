During my PhD, I spent a year as a writer for the psychiatry department's news team before taking on the role of editor for 2 years. You can read some of the articles I worked on here: https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/blog/category/news/

At the end of my PhD, I did a short interview with the news team about my thesis research. You can read that here: https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/blog/2019/03/11/congratulations-to-owen-parsons-for-completing-his-phd/
